# Introduction #

This example project demonstrates Azure NetX Duo's networking capabilities using the Ethernet physical layer of the RA MCU. It leverages the NetX Duo network stack to execute various network operations, such as sending and receiving data over a network. The RA board will automatically obtain an IP address from the network using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client service.

Once the RA board successfully acquires the IP address, users can interact with the system by selecting options from a menu, which is accessible via the RTT Viewer or a terminal application running on the host PC. After the RA board retrieves its IP address from the router, it will display the network configuration details, along with the available menu options, in the terminal application. This enables the user to explore different features and operations supported by the network stack.

The available operations include:
* TCP Client Service: Connect to a server, send a request, wait for a response from the server, and disconnect from the server.
* UDP Client Service: Send a request and wait for a response from the server.
* DNS Client Service: Retrieve both the A record (forward lookup) and PTR record (reverse lookup), enabling the system to resolve domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.
* Web HTTP Server: Handle HTTP requests from the browser, including requesting the homepage, retrieving board network configuration, controlling onboard LEDs, and requesting the status of onboard LEDs.

The menu options:
* Type `1 <x.x.x.x>:<port>` to perform TCP client operation.
* Type `2 <x.x.x.x>:<port>` to perform UDP client operation.
* Type `3 <x.x.x.x>` to get the PTR record for the specified address. Type `3 <domain>` to get the A record for the specified domain.
* Type `4` to start the web HTTP server.

Notes: 
* To display information, users can select between the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer and the Serial Terminal (UART) with J-Link OB VCOM. 
* By default, the EP information is printed to the host PC via the Serial Terminal.
* To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please follow the instructions in the NetX_tcp_udp_notes.md file.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ## 
To build and run the NetX_tcp_udp example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware Requirements ###
* Supported RA boards: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1
* 1 x Ethernet router with an internet connection
* 2 x Ethernet cables to connect the RA board and the host PC to the router
* 1 x Micro USB cable for programming, debugging, and status display on the terminal (Tera Term or SEGGER RTT J-Link Viewer)

### Hardware Connections  ###
* Power on the Router: Ensure the router is powered on and properly connected to the internet. Verify that the routerâ€™s LAN ports are active and available for connections.
* Connect the RA Board to the Router: Take an Ethernet cable and connect one end to the Ethernet port on the RA board, and the other end to one of the router's available LAN ports. This connection allows the RA board to communicate with the network and obtain an IP address via DHCP.
* Connect the Host PC to the Router: Using a second Ethernet cable, connect the host PC to another LAN port on the same router. This step ensures that both the RA board and the host PC are on the same network, enabling communication between them for debugging and menu operations.
* Connect the RA Board to the Host PC: Using a micro-USB cable, connect the RA board to the host PC. This connection is necessary for programming the RA board, enabling debugging, and displaying runtime information in the terminal or RTT Viewer on the host PC.
* By following these steps, you'll establish proper hardware connections between the RA board, the router, and the host PC, ensuring smooth network communication and debugging capabilities.
* For EK-RA8D1: Set the configuration switches (SW1) as below.
    | SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
    |-------------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
    |     OFF     |     OFF     |      OFF     |     OFF    |     ON     |     OFF    |     OFF     |    OFF    |
* For EK-RA8M1: Remove jumper J61 to enable Ethernet B.

### Software Requirements ###
* Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 5.8.0
* e2 studio: Version 2025-01
* GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.2.1.arm-13-7
* Terminal Console Application: Tera Term version 4.99 or SEGGER RTT J-Link Viewer version 8.10f
* Web Browser Application: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome.
* Socket Application: Sokit.

Refer to the software required section in [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

Note: Sokit (Socket Application) setup on PC as TCP, UDP server
1. Download sokit tool form https://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/Misc-Networking-Tools/sokit.shtml
2. Once downloaded, extract the contents and start sokit.exe.
3. Once started, in the 'Server' tab configure the 'Network Setup'.
4. Input the server's IP address and the port number
    * For TCP: In the 'TCP Addr' field, enter the PC's IPv4 address. And in 'Port' field, enter the port number.
    * For UDP: In the 'UDP Addr' field, enter the PC's IPv4 address. And in 'Port' field, enter the port number.
    
Note: Please provide an unused port number. It is recommended to give port number greater than 10,000.

5. Start the TCP, UDP server on PC.
    * For TCP: Click the 'TCP Listen' button. This would start the TCP server on PC.
    * For UDP: Click the 'UDP Listen' button. This would start the UDP server on PC.
6. The connection log will display on the 'Output window' on the PC.
    * For TCP: The 'Output' window would display the message 'hh:mm:ss MSG start TCP server successfully!'.
    * For UDP: The 'Output' window would display the message 'hh:mm:ss MSG start UDP server successfully!'.
7. Now wait for the EP to connect to server.
8. Once the EP connects to the server, the 'Connections' window would display the IP address and port number of the client.
9. There are three user input buffers provided for sending messages i.e. 'Buf 1', 'Buf 2' and 'Buf 3'.
10. In one buffer, enter 'This is a response sent from the TCP server'.
11. While sending, select the IP address of the client i.e. the MCU from the 'Connections' window. 
12. And then click 'Send' button of the appropriate buffer to send message.
13. Messages received from the client will be displayed on the 'Output' window.
14. The 'Output' window and console display messages upon each transaction.
15. To stop the server
    * For TCP: Click the 'TCP Listen' button again. This would stop the server.
    * For UDP: Click the 'UDP Listen' button again. This would stop the server.
